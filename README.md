## 🚀 IBM Data Science Certification (Sep 2022 – Jan 2023)  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SQL, Scikit-learn  

### 🛰️ Falcon 9 Landing Success Prediction  
Developed machine learning models to predict the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings using SpaceX API data and Wikipedia web scraping.  

### 🔍 Key Contributions:  
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:** Transformed raw data into a structured Pandas DataFrame, handling missing values and outliers.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Queried data using **SQL** and visualized feature relationships with **Matplotlib**, identifying **payload mass** and **launch site** as key predictors.  
- **Model Development & Optimization:**  
  - Trained **Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, and Decision Trees**.  
  - Achieved **94% accuracy** with Logistic Regression & KNN.  
  - Optimized models using **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Insights:**  
  - Lower-mass payloads had a **higher probability of successful landings**.  
  - Certain launch sites showed significantly **better success rates**.  

📊 **Outcome:** Demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for Falcon 9 landings, leveraging data science techniques to extract actionable insights.
